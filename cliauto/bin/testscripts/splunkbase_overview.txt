For the less technically informed, CLI stands for "Command Line Interface" while "Auto" is a reference to automation.

If you answer "Yes" to any of the following questions, you may want to consider downloading/installing this app with the assistance of your local friendly Splunk administrator/power user.

- Do you manage/support several (10+, 100+, 1000+, etc.) network devices that have a CLI (Command Line Interface)?
- Has your team been requested to meet a compliance mandate (e.g. periodic password change) for your numerous CLI compatible network devices ?
- Does your team spend numerous man hours performing management/support tasks on network devices that might be solved by automation via CLI?

For those folks that have had the good fortune to work/study within the IT networking and/or cyber security fields, you probably are aware that several brands/models of networking devices have a CLI (Command Line Interface). Examples of network devices are firewalls, routers, switches, gateways, servers, wireless access points, workstations/laptops, etc. Also you may be aware, the more modern network devices typically use the ssh (Secure Shell) protocol to secure a CLI network session. It should be noted that this app only supports the ssh CLI protocol. In other words, this app does not support other CLI protocols like Telnet. 

For the more technically minded, the CLI Auto app provides a job engine (via a custom REST API endpoint) and an user interface to connect to several nodes (hosts) via ssh to execute and index (i.e. log to Splunk) the output of a Command Type (i.e. a set of CLI commands).
