imageCaption1 = Most modern network nodes (e.g. Sonicwall firewall) have a CLI (Command Line Interface) enabling remote access using OpenSSH (ssh).
imageName1 = login.gif
skipText = Skip tour
imageCaption2 = As an example of a more complicated network node, a Sonicwall firewall using High Availability (HA -Active/Standby) requires configuration changes to be performed on the current Active node.
imageName2 = ha_status.gif
imageCaption3 = After verifying the node is the currently Active node, the admin password can be changed and saved (i.e.  commit).
imageName3 = config_admin_passchange.gif
imageCaption4 = The CLI Auto app provides automation via the CLI to determine the current Active node (HA - Active/Standby) and make configuration changes (e.g. admin password change) for hundreds of Sonicwall firewalls without needing to login to each node.
imageName4 = cliauto_passchange.gif
imageCaption5 = Depending on the number of nodes that your team manages/supports, it could reduce the time to perform this task from days/hours/minutes to seconds.

imageCaption1 = Create a CSV file with your node records using your favorite text editor. A header record with field names (host, ip_address) is required.
imageCaption2 = In the Splunk UI, click Settings->Lookups.
imageCaption3 = Click Add New for Lookup table files.
imageCaption4 = Select cliauto for the Destination app, click the Choose File button to select your Node List CSV file, give the Destination file an appropriate name, and click Save.

imageCaption1 = There are 3 prerequisites to creating CLI Auto Command Types. For the first 2 prerequisites , you must have read/write permissions to the CLI Auto app folder on your Splunk server and the right to restart and/or refresh Splunk.
imageName1 = cliauto_folder.png
skipText = Skip tour
imageCaption2 = Third, you must know how to edit Splunk conf files.
imageName2 = edit_splunk_conf.gif
imageCaption3 = After satisfying the prerequisites, create the local folder in the CLI Auto app's folder if it does not exist.
imageName3 = create_local_folder.gif
imageCaption4 = Create a cliauto_cmds.conf file with a text editor in the CLI Auto local folder. Add a conf file stanza with your new Command Type (e.g. cli_linux_uname) to the file.
imageName4 = create_cliauto_cmds_file.gif
imageCaption5 = For reference, the cliauto_cmds.conf.spec file provides some help for available key/value pair properties to create a Command Type.
imageName5 = readme_conf_spec_file.gif
imageCaption6 = For another reference, the cliauto_cmds.conf file in the CLI Auto default folder contains example Command Types. It is recommended that the default folder files NOT be changed.
imageName6 = default_cliauto_cmds_file.gif
imageCaption7 = After creating your Command Type, restart Splunk and/or refresh Splunk to update Splunk's active configuration. To restart Splunk, click Settings->Server Controls.
